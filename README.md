# Information Extraction Methodology Study

This repoistory contains code that investigates the ability of an information extraction methodology to reduce entity existence hallucinations.

The MAVEN and RAMs datasets are not included and should be placed into a folder called "data". 

The "driver" Python scripts in the root of the repository reflect the general order to recreate the results of this study.  Some configuration adjustments are required to generate data with different LLM models; thus, review of these configuration settings is suggested before execution. Note that the "driver_06_analyze.py" is changed to required some of the results from "driver_07..." and "driver_08...".
